The focus here is to automate customer support for businesses with Natural Language Processing. . You can find me exploring the world of data and tech in my free-time. . I believe that tech is at its best when it brings people together to solve issues for mankind to excel and shatter barriers and limitations which stood in its journey. . In retrospect of my free time, I read books that help me think (although they make me sleepy too :P). At present, I am reading Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life. . A small request from you. Please don’t be a silent reader and do connect with me on the links provided in the endnote. Suggestions, reviews, edits, and opinions are always welcome! . Until then, Carpe Diem! .",
